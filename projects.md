#### 1. Intelligent security analysis [source code: [GITEE](https://gitee.com/fdu-ssr/lian), [GITHUB](https://github.com/yang-guangliang/lian)]
Lian conducts precise code semantic analysis with multi-language support (e.g., C/LLVM/Java/Python/JavaScript/PHP/Typescript/ArkTS), and a comprehensive suite of semantic understanding techniques:
  - Interprocedural data flow analysis
  - Context-, field-, flow-, and branch-sensitive program state analysis
  - Taint analysis

#### 2. Memory safe language
C/C++ have been prevalent in past years but often suffer from serious security vulnerabilities. Our goal is to provide a new language and safe compiler to eliminate vulnerabilities.

#### 3. AI system statck   
We expand our new language to facilicate the development and design of ops with the universal supports of various hardward and AI frameworks.
