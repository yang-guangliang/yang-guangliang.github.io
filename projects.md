### Recent Projects

#### 1. LIAN: a software Analysis platform [source code: [GITEE](https://gitee.com/fdu-ssr/lian), [GITHUB](https://github.com/yang-guangliang/lian)]
Lian can conduct precise program analysis with multi-language support (e.g., C/LLVM/Java/Python/JavaScript/PHP/Typescript/ArkTS), and a comprehensive suite of semantic understanding techniques:
  - Interprocedural data flow analysis
  - Context-, Field-, Flow-, and Branch-Sensitive Program State Analysis
  - Taint Analysis

#### 2. Enhancing C/C++ Security
C/C++ have been prevalent in past years but often suffer from serious security vulnerabilities. Our goal is to enhance the security of these languages through advanced analysis and mitigation techniques.

#### 3. AI System Optimization
In this project, we aim to boost the performance of AI frameworks by fully utilizing the capabilities of current diverse hardware architectures. This includes optimizing for CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and other specialized hardware to maximize efficiency and throughput.
