#### Guangliang Yang

I am an  assistant professor of the School of Computer Science at Fundan University. Before I joined Fudan, I earned the PhD degree from Texas A&M University and was a postdoctoral fellow of Georgia Tech.  
My research mainly focuses on computer system security. I am interested in  
 
 - discovering novel security issues, and
 - automating security flaw analysis, detection, and mitigation.
