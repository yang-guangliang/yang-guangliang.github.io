### Intro

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, where I lead the System Security & Reliability ([SSR](https://gitee.com/fudan-csr)) research group. Prior to joining Fudan in 2021, I earned my PhD from Texas A&M University in 2019 and conducted postdoctoral research at Georgia Tech.

Our research at SSR focuses on constructing reliable systems and programming paradigms. We pioneer methods to fortify real-world software infrastructure against evolving security threats through language and systems co-design. Key areas include:

- Software Security
   - Vulnerability detection in large-scale systems (Linux kernel, Chrome, web/mobile platforms)
   - Formal methods for security verification
- Compilation Techniques
   - Traditional compiler optimizations
   - AI system
- Language Design
   - Memory-safe programming language
   - Accelerator-oriented DSLs for TPUs/GPUs
