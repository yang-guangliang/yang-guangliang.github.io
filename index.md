I am an assistant professor of the School of Computer Science at Fundan University. Before I joined Fudan, I earned the PhD degree from Texas A&M University and was a postdoctoral fellow of Georgia Tech.  

My research mainly focuses on computer system security. I am interested in  
 
 - Investigating the security of system models, and discovering novel vulnerabilities;
 - Designing and developing novel automated approaches to analyze, detect, and mitigate security flaws.
