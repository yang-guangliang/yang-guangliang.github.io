I am an assistant professor of the School of Computer Science at Fundan University. Before joining Fudan, I earned my PhD degree from Texas A&M University and was a postdoctoral fellow of Georgia Tech. 

My research mainly focuses on system security and AI security. My interests include practicalizing automatic security-verifying techniques (e.g., programming language and AI), and developing reliable security defense systems.
