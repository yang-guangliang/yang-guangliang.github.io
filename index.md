### Intro

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science at Fudan University. 

My research focuses on computer and AI security. I am particularly passionate about devising and improving security verification and mitigation approaches for practical and real-world utilization. Our mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge security research and the development of effective and reliable security systems.
