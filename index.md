### Intro

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, where I lead the FDU Computer Systems Research Group (CSR) (FDU-CSR). Prior to joining Fudan in 2021, I earned my PhD from Texas A&M University in 2019 and conducted postdoctoral research at Georgia Tech.

My research focuses on system security and programming technologies, combining classic approaches with AI innovations to secure complex real-world systems. Specific directions include:

- Software Security
   - Vulnerability detection in large-scale systems (Linux kernel, Chrome, web/mobile platforms)
   - Formal methods for security verification
- Compilation Techniques
   - Traditional compiler optimizations
   - AI-driven program analysis and compilation
- Language Design
   - Memory-safe programming language architectures
   - Accelerator-oriented DSLs for TPUs/GPUs
