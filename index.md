I am an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, where I lead the System Security & Reliability ([SSR](https://gitee.com/fudan-csr)) research group. Prior to joining Fudan in 2021, I earned my PhD from Texas A&M University in 2019 and conducted postdoctoral research at Georgia Tech.

Our research at SSR focuses on constructing reliable programming paradigms and secure systems. We innovate and leveraging cutting-edge approaches to strengthen real-world software against evolving security threats through the co-design of languages and systems. Key areas include:

- Security vetting 
   - Vulnerability detection in large-scale systems 
   - Application of formal methods for security analysis
- Safe programming
   - Design and implementation of memory-safe programming languages
   - Development of accelerator-oriented domain-specific languages (DSLs) for TPUs and GPUs
- Reliable compilation
   - Optimization techniques in traditional compilers
   - AI system improvement
