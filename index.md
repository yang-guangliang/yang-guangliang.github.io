I am an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, where I lead the System Security & Reliability ([SSR](https://gitee.com/fudan-csr)) research group. Prior to joining Fudan in 2021, I earned my PhD from Texas A&M University in 2019 and subsequently conducted postdoctoral research at Georgia Tech. 

Our research at SSR is dedicated to constructing and advancing reliable and secure software by addressing foundational challenges in the design, implementation, and verification of evolving hardware-software coding.
