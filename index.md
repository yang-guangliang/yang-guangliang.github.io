I am an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, where I lead the System Security & Reliability ([SSR](https://gitee.com/fudan-csr)) research group. Prior to joining Fudan in 2021, I earned my PhD from Texas A&M University in 2019 and subsequently conducted postdoctoral research at Georgia Tech. 

Our research at SSR is dedicated to constructing and advancing reliable and secure computing systems by addressing foundational challenges in the design, implementation, and verification of evolving hardware-software computating infrastructures. Key areas include:

- Security vetting 
   - Vulnerability detection in large-scale systems 
   - Application of formal methods for security analysis
- High-performance safe programming
   - Design and implementation of memory-safe programming languages
   - Language-level hardware abstraction 
- Reliable computing system
   - System stack construction
   - AI system optimization and acceleration
